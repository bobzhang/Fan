  you could have some benefit, like
  when do the map traversal, you can map it to nil as a way of
  removing them.


  without type annotations, the compilation time may downgrade in
  some cases, should the quotation add type annotations automatically ?

* rules
  {-# RULES
  "map/map"    forall f g xs.  map f (map g xs) = map (f.g) xs
  "map/append" forall f xs ys. map f (xs ++ ys) = map f xs ++ map f ys
    #-}

  {:map| "row_field"
   fun [ {|$vrn:x of loc|} -> {|$vrn:x|}
   | $vrn:x of (loc * $y) -> 
      match y with
      [{:ctyp| $_ * $_ |} -> {|$vrn:x of $tup:y |}
      |_ -> {|$vrn:x of $y|}]   ]
