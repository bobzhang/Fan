Fan is a successor to [[http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Camlp4][Camlp4]], which was mainly developed by
[[http://pauillac.inria.fr/~ddr/][Daniel de Rauglaudre]] and [[http://michel.mauny.net/index.en.php][Michel Mauny]], and later was largely
renovated by [[http://nicolaspouillard.fr/][Nicolas Pouillard]].

In the fall semester of 2011, I had an indepedent study with [[http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/][Stephanie Weirich]] on
"generic programming in Haskell", later I ported it into OCaml using
Camlp4 in the spring semester of 2012.

Later, I found Camlp4 too slow and verbose, and it's very hard to write a plugin
for it, then I started Fan as a research project under the guidance
of [[http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/][Steve Zdancewic]], from July 2012.

Special thanks to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)][John McCarthy]] and [[http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/][Xavier Leory]] for their
contribution to language design.
