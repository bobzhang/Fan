* Playing with toplevel

   If you have ocamlfind installed, the easiest way to explore fan is
   starting the toplevel:

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     # #require "fan.top";;
     /Users/bobzhang1988/.opam/4.00.1/lib/fan: added to search path
     /Users/bobzhang1988/.opam/4.00.1/lib/fan/fanTop.cma: loaded
     # let a = {:exp-|3|};;
     val a : FAstN.exp = `Int "3"
   #+END_SRC
   Here "exp-" is a built-in DDSL for quasiquotation, see [[file:ddsl/quotation.org][DDSL:quotation]]
   
   There are two  directives added,

   1. normal
      #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
        #normal;;      
      #+END_SRC
      This directive would restore the toplevel to the default
      behavior, it's useful sometimes, for examlpe, you want to load
      a normal ocaml file instead of file pre-processed by Fan.
   2. fan
      #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
        #fan;;
      #+END_SRC
      It will turn on the featurs of fan.
      
      
* Playing with utop
  [[https://github.com/diml/utop][Utop]] is a toplevel with nice auto-completion support, it's very
  helpful for explore some libraries which the user is not familiar
  with.

  There is adapter for fan, namely ftop, available here:
  https://github.com/bobzhang/ftop
