Fan's history
=============


Fan is a successor to
`Camlp4`_, which was
mainly developed by `Daniel de Rauglaudre`_ and `Michel Mauny`_,
and later was largely renovated by `Nicolas Pouillard`_.

In the fall semester of 2011, I had an indepedent study with
`Stephanie Weirich`_ on ``Generic programming in Haskell``, later I
ported it into `OCaml`_ using `Camlp4`_ in the spring semester
of 2012.

Later, I found `Camlp4`_ too slow and verbose, and it's very hard to
write a plugin for it, then I started `Fan`_ as a research project
under the guidance of `Steve Zdancewic`_, from July 2012.

Special thanks to `John McCarthy`_  and `Xavier Leory`_ for their contribution to proramming language design.
