<p>
Fan is a successor to <a href="http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Camlp4">Camlp4</a>, which was mainly developed by
<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~ddr/">Daniel de Rauglaudre</a> and <a href="http://michel.mauny.net/index.en.php">Michel Mauny</a>, and later was largely
renovated by <a href="http://nicolaspouillard.fr/">Nicolas Pouillard</a>.
</p>

<p>
In fall semester 2011, I had an indepedent study with <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie</a> on
"generic programming in Haskell", later I ported it into OCaml using
Camlp4 in spring semester 2012.
</p>

<p>
Shortly, I was annoyed by some designs of Camlp4, and started Fan as a
research project under the guidance of <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/">Steve</a>, from July 2012.
