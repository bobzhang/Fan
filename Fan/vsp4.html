Unfortunately, though Camlp4 is
a very powerful tool to program OCaml Ast and extending OCaml
language, Camlp4 is so complex that lately it grows out of
      control. Fan adopts most good ideas of Camlp4 and merges some
      new ideas.  Fan is way more <b>faster</b> than Camlp4!
</p>

<p>
Compared with Camlp4, Fan is written in OCaml syntax instead of
inventing a new syntax, and it has a very robust bootstrapping
system compared with Camlp4.

Fan is written in a functional way, it supports nested
quotation, antiquotation and oveerloaded quasiquotations.
