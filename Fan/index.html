<a href="https://github.com/bobzhang/Fan">Fan</a> is a compile-time metaprogramming system for <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">OCaml</a>, originally
imported from <a href="http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Camlp4">Camlp4</a>. It's a combination of OCaml and Lisp-like
<a href="http://letoverlambda.com/">Macros</a>. It shares the same <a href="concrete_syntax.html">concrete syntax</a> with OCaml.

<h2 id="sec-1">The philosophy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Unlike traditional programming languages, Fan is <i>a set of
languages</i> which could <i>evolve</i> itself incrementally. It gets started
from the vanilla OCaml language as Fan<sub>0</sub>, with more and more new
languages added for each version.
</p>

<p>
For example, to add a new sub-language into Fan<sub>n</sub>, we would
supply a front-end and a back-end targeted at Fan<sub>n</sub>, upon being
integrated, Fan<sub>n</sub> becomes Fan<sub>n+1</sub>.
</p>

<p>
We could grow Fan endlessly in such a way, however, the main point
for Fan is not that me, the lead developer of Fan could keep adding
features to itself, its innovative point lies in the following two
aspects:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It encourages programmer to think about programming in a
bottom-up way.  Unlike the traditional problem-oriented approach,
language-oriented programming is encouraged: delimited domain
specific language(<a href="ddsl.html">DDSL</a>) is the best abstraction for a specific
domain.
</li>

<li>Everyone, including you: the reader,  could join and develop a
mini-compiler and share with other people. Fan servers as a
platform to glue them tegother.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Please bear in mind that Fan is still at alpha release, so it's
expected there would be tons of bugs. This also means that your
participation is particularly important, and your suggestions will
affect the design of Fan.
