syntactic sugar, no matter how complex the syntax sugar is, but bear
in mind that every language is a syntax sugar of machine code.

<p>
Growing a language dynamically is a very very powerful feature, more
importantly, it makes compiler building decentralized possible, for
some features, the user does not need to submit a request and wait
for several years, ending up a rejection. The main point is that
building a compiler is not a rocket science, everyone could
participate and submit their components, Fan helps to glue them
together to provide the best user experience.

<p>
That said, Fan will not grow in an endless way, it mainly only
consist of the following components:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>core DDSL for compiler building 
</li>
</ol>

Fan comes with two binaries: fan.byte and fan.native. Their
features set will be <i>slightly</i> different in the future, for the
time being, the user could just assume they are the same thing.
