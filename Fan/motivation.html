<h2 id="sec-1">Why metaprogramming for OCaml?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">wikipedia</a>,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Metaprogramming is the writing of computer
programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as
their data.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Computer programmers value abstraction, and metaprogramming is one
of the most powerful abstractions, <i>i.e.</i> abstraction over
code. Decent metaprogramming system enables great programmers to
finish the same project in an astoundingly short piece of code
compared languages without metaprogramming. 
</p>

<p>
OCaml is a great language for hackers, it embodies the most
important features as a modern functional programming language:
algebraic data type, pattern match, dynamic binding and type
inference.
</p>

<p>
Compared with Haskell, it has a humble type system, however, the coolest
thing is simplicity, it's not too hard to get a general idea of the
whole technology stack of OCaml, and its compiler is very
hackable. My pruned OCaml compiler compiles in less than 10
seconds in a unicore. Compile time is a <b>very important</b> factor
for the language selection since the time of programmer is
precious, really, you don't like to have a coffee to wait for
compiling&#x2026;. .
</p>

<p>
In some languages, it takes 1 seconds to compile a 'hello-world'
program :-(.
